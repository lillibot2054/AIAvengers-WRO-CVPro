# ü§ñ AI Avengers ‚Äì WRO Future Engineers 

## üìå Project Overview

AI Avengers is a robotics project built for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Future Engineers** category.
Our bot integrates **Computer Vision, AI-based decision making, and sensor fusion** to perform autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, and color-based decision tasks.

The design is based on the **CV Pro Competition Kit** with additional modules and custom programming.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

Our bot uses the following components:

* **ESP32 Dev Board** (Main Controller ‚Äì Dual-core, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth support)
* **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors** (Distance and obstacle detection)

  * FUS (Front Ultrasonic Sensor)
  * FUS1 & FUS2 (Additional front sensors for precision)
  * RUS (Right Ultrasonic Sensor)
  * LUS (Left Ultrasonic Sensor)
* **Adafruit TCS34725 Color Sensor** (#1334 ‚Äì I2C based, RGB detection for floor markers & decision-making)
* **Servo Motor** (for angle-based movement and actuation)
* **Lithium-Ion 3.7V 3200mAh battery** with charging circuit
* **Motor Driver** (for controlled wheel movement)
* **RGB LED Indicator**
